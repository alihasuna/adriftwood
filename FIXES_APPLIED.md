# Fixes Applied - Animation & Font Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fonts Not Working**
**Problem:** Custom font files (Alta Caption) don't exist yet, causing fallback to system fonts.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Added Google Fonts import for **Playfair Display** (similar to Alta Caption) and **Montserrat**
- ✅ Updated Tailwind config to use Playfair Display as first choice before Alta Caption
- ✅ Fonts now load immediately from Google CDN

**File Changes:**
- `app/globals.css` - Added Google Fonts import
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Updated font-family stack

**Result:** Fonts work immediately without needing custom font files!

### 2. **Hero Animations Not Visible**
**Problem:** Animations were too subtle and didn't create the dramatic entrance effect shown in the reference image.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ **Background Image:** Added fade-in from opacity 0 with slow zoom (1.5s duration)
- ✅ **Main Title:** Large "Adriftwood" text animates from bottom with 50px Y offset (1.2s duration)
- ✅ **Side Text:** Added "50 YEARS OF QUALITY..." text that slides in from right (inspired by your reference)
- ✅ **Center Tagline:** Scales and fades in from 90% size (1s duration)
- ✅ **Staggered Timing:** Each element appears in sequence for cinematic effect

**Timing Sequence:**
1. 0.0s - Background fades in
2. 0.4s - Main title rises from bottom
3. 0.6s - Center content scales in
4. 0.8s - Side text slides from right
5. 1.0s - Tagline fades in
6. 1.5s - Scroll indicator appears

**File Changed:**
- `components/home/hero.tsx` - Complete animation overhaul

---

### 3. **Category Tiles Animation Enhanced**
**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Tiles animate from 60px below with scale effect (0.95 → 1.0)
- ✅ Staggered by 150ms between each tile
- ✅ 0.8s duration for smooth, noticeable entrance
- ✅ Hover animation moved to Framer Motion for smoother performance

**File Changed:**
- `components/home/category-tiles.tsx`

---

### 4. **Manifesto Section Enhanced**
**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Title slides in from 20px below
- ✅ Each paragraph appears sequentially with stagger
- ✅ Call-to-action button fades in last
- ✅ Delays create reading rhythm

**File Changed:**
- `components/home/manifesto.tsx`

---

### 5. **Featured Products Enhanced**
**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Section title slides from left (-30px)
- ✅ "View all" link slides from right (+30px)
- ✅ Product cards rise from 50px below
- ✅ Staggered by 120ms for cascading effect

**File Changed:**
- `components/home/featured-products.tsx`

## 🚀 How to See It Working

### Option 1: Quick Test with Placeholder Images
1. Follow instructions in `QUICK_START_IMAGES.md`
2. Download hero and category images
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Automated Download (Mac/Linux)
```bash
# Create the script
cat > download-images.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p public/images/categories
curl -L "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511497584788-876760111969?w=2400" -o public/images/hero-forest.jpg

## 🎨 What You'll See

When you load the homepage now:

1. **Hero Section:**
   - Background fades in smoothly
   - "Adriftwood" title rises from bottom (dramatic!)
   - Tagline appears in center
   - "50 YEARS OF QUALITY..." slides in from right
   - Scroll indicator bounces gently

2. **Scroll Down:**
   - Category tiles pop up one by one with scale effect
   - Manifesto text appears paragraph by paragraph
   - Product cards cascade in with stagger
   - All animations trigger as you scroll into view

3. **Hover Effects:**
   - Category images zoom smoothly
   - Product cards scale slightly
   - All transitions feel polished

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Performance:** All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- **Once:** Animations trigger once per scroll (use `viewport={{ once: true }}`)
- **Smooth:** Custom easing creates organic, professional feel
- **Mobile:** All animations work on mobile devices

## 🔄 Reverting to Custom Fonts Later

When you get the Alta Caption font files:

1. Add font files to `/public/fonts/`
2. The existing `@font-face` declarations will automatically use them
3. Remove or keep the Google Fonts import (Playfair will be ignored if Alta Caption loads)

---

**All animations are now visible and dramatic - just like the reference image! 🎉**
