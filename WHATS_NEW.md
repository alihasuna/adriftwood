# ✨ What's New - Advanced Scroll Effects & Logo Integration

## 🎬 New "Wow" Effects

Your site now has **cinematic scroll animations** that are elegant and minimalistic!

### What You'll Notice

**1. Parallax Scrolling** 🌲
- Background trees move at different speeds than content
- Creates depth and dimensionality
- Subtle but impactful

**2. 3D Rotation Effects** 🔄
- Section headings rotate slightly on Y-axis as they appear
- Text "turns" toward you for dramatic entrance
- Only 10-15° rotation (subtle, not overwhelming)

**3. Scroll-Linked Animations** 📜
- Content opacity tied directly to scroll position
- Elements fade in as you enter, fade out as you leave
- Smooth transitions throughout journey

**4. Sophisticated Stagger** ⏱️
- Child elements appear in choreographed sequence
- 180ms delays between items (slower, more dramatic)
- Creates a "waterfall" cascade effect

**5. Scale + Transform** 📐
- Sections scale from 90% → 100% → 95% as you scroll
- Creates a "breathing" effect
- Adds organic movement

**6. Your Tree Logo Everywhere** 🌲
- Navbar (animated on hover)
- Footer (warm apricot color)
- Decorative backgrounds (5% opacity, parallax)
- Subtle brand reinforcement throughout
