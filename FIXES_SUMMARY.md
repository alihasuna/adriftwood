# Site Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed - October 2, 2025

### ✅ 1. Custom Cursor Not Working on About & Store Pages

**Problem:** The custom cursor effect was only visible on the home page and pages within the `(site)` group. The about and store pages didn't have the cursor effect.

**Root Cause:** The `CustomCursor` component was only included in `/app/(site)/layout.tsx`, which doesn't apply to pages outside the `(site)` directory (like `/app/about/` and `/app/store/`).

**Solution:** Moved all UI components to the root layout (`/app/layout.tsx`) so they apply globally to all pages:
- `CustomCursor` - Custom white dot cursor with hover effects
- `CursorGlow` - Cursor glow effect
- `AmbientGradient` - Background ambient gradients
- `LightBeams` - Subtle light beam effects
- `Navbar` - Navigation menu
- `Footer` - Site footer
- `CartDrawer` - Shopping cart
- `ScrollProgress` - Scroll progress indicator
- `PageTransition` & `SunsetTransition` - Page transition effects

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Added all UI components
- `/app/(site)/layout.tsx` - Simplified to pass-through layout

### ✅ 2. Navigation Menu Missing on About & Store Pages

**Problem:** Users couldn't navigate back to other pages when on the about or store pages. No navbar was visible.

**Root Cause:** Same as issue #1 - the `Navbar` component was only in the `(site)` layout.

**Solution:** Moved `Navbar` to the root layout so it appears on all pages.

**Result:** Users can now navigate freely between all pages from any page.

### ✅ 3. Unprofessional Particle Effects

**Problem:** The `AmbientParticles` component created floating white dots that looked unprofessional.

**Solution:** 
- Removed `AmbientParticles` component from the site entirely
- Kept other ambient effects (gradients, light beams, cursor glow) that are more subtle and professional

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Removed `AmbientParticles` import and component
- `/app/(site)/layout.tsx` - Removed from old location

### ✅ 4. Green Background Color in Newsletter Section

**Problem:** The "STAY CONNECTED" newsletter section had a dark green background (`bg-brand-pine` - #044002) that didn't fit the brand aesthetic.

**Solution:** 
- Changed background from `bg-brand-pine` (green) to `bg-neutral-900` (elegant dark neutral)
- Increased bronze gradient accent opacity from 10% to 20% for better visual interest
- Maintained the same layout and typography

**Visual Impact:**
- Before: Dark green (#044002) background
- After: Sophisticated dark neutral (#262626) background with subtle bronze accents

**Files Modified:**
- `/components/home/newsletter-cta.tsx` - Changed background color

## Testing Recommendations

Please test the following:

1. **Cursor Effect:**
   - ✓ Visit /about page - cursor should work
   - ✓ Visit /store page - cursor should work
   - ✓ Hover over links/buttons - cursor should scale up with ring effect

2. **Navigation:**
   - ✓ Navigate to /about - navbar should be visible
   - ✓ Navigate to /store - navbar should be visible
   - ✓ Click navbar links to navigate between pages

3. **Visual Quality:**
   - ✓ No floating particle dots visible
   - ✓ Newsletter section has dark neutral background (not green)
   - ✓ Ambient effects (gradients, light beams) are subtle and professional

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - ✓ Test on mobile - hamburger menu should work on all pages
   - ✓ Test on tablet - all effects should work properly
   - ✓ Test on desktop - full navbar visible on all pages

## Technical Notes

### Layout Architecture
The site now uses a standard Next.js 14 layout pattern:
- **Root Layout** (`/app/layout.tsx`): Contains all global UI components and effects
- **Route Group Layouts** (like `(site)/layout.tsx`): Can add route-specific configurations but don't duplicate global UI

### Benefits of This Approach
1. ✅ Consistent UI across all pages
2. ✅ Custom cursor works everywhere
3. ✅ Navigation always accessible
4. ✅ Easier to maintain (one source of truth)
5. ✅ Better performance (components loaded once at root)

### Color Palette Reference
The site now uses these primary backgrounds:
- `bg-neutral-50` (#FAFAFA) - Light pages (default)
- `bg-neutral-900` (#0D0D0D) - Dark sections (newsletter)
- `bg-brand-pine` (#044002) - Accent color only (buttons, highlights)
