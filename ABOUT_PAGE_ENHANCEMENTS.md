**Advanced Motion:**
- Uses `parallaxUp`, `sophisticatedStagger`, and `fadeBlurUp` variants
- Staggered reveal with blur effects
- Vertical parallax on middle paragraph

---

### 3. **Timeline Section** (`components/about/timeline.tsx`)
**New Features:**
- 📈 **Animated timeline line** that fills as you scroll (gradient color)

- 📦 **Card hover effects** - lift and scale on hover
- ✨ **Sparkles icon** next to section title
- 💫 **Slide-rotate animations** for each timeline item
- 🎨 **Enhanced visual cards** with shadows and borders

**Scroll Effects:**
- Timeline line height is controlled by scroll progress (0% to 100%)
- Each event has staggered animations

---

### 4. **Factory Stats Section** (`components/about/factory-stats.tsx`)
**New Features:**
- 🔢 **Animated number counters** - count up from 0 to target value
- 🎈 **Floating icon animations** - continuous up/down movement
- ✨ **Glowing icon backgrounds** - pulsing scale and opacity
- 🧲 **Magnetic hover effect** - cards respond to hover with rotation
- 🎨 **Decorative background blobs** with gradients
- 📊 **Animated decorative bars** in section header
- 💎 **Glass-morphism cards** with backdrop blur
- 🌟 **Bottom border animations** that expand on reveal

**Advanced Features:**
- Custom `AnimatedCounter` component with easing
- Uses `useInView` hook for precise animation triggers
- Staggered delays for each stat card
- Continuous floating animations with different delays

---

### 5. **Project Mosaic Section** (`components/about/project-mosaic.tsx`)
**New Features:**
- 🖼️ **Image reveal animations** with zoom effect
- 🎯 **Hover lift effect** - cards move up and scale
- 🔄 **Image zoom + rotate** on hover
- ⬆️ **Arrow icon** appears on hover
- 📌 **Corner accent** decorative element
- 🌊 **Parallax background blob** moves with scroll
- ✨ **Animated gradient overlays**
- 📏 **Decorative line** that expands horizontally
- 💫 **Enhanced gradients** on image overlays

**Scroll & Hover Effects:**
- Background decorative blob has parallax movement
- Images scale and rotate on hover
- Cards lift up with spring animation
- Subtle corner accents animate in

---

## 🎯 Animation Techniques Used

### From `lib/advanced-motion.ts`:
- `parallaxUp` - Smooth upward reveal with scale
- `sophisticatedStagger` - Staggered children animations
- `slideRotateUp` - Slide up with slight rotation
- `fadeBlurUp` - Fade in with blur removal
- `scaleBlurIn` - Scale and blur effect
- `imageReveal` - Zoom out image reveal
- `magneticHover` - Interactive hover with rotation

### From Framer Motion Hooks:
- `useScroll` - Track scroll progress
- `useTransform` - Transform values based on scroll
- `useInView` - Detect when element is in viewport
- `whileHover` - Interactive hover states
- `whileInView` - Trigger animations on viewport entry

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

All animations are optimized:
- ✅ Uses `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent re-animation
- ✅ GPU-accelerated transforms (translate, scale, rotate)
- ✅ Efficient scroll listeners with proper cleanup
- ✅ Lazy animation triggers with margin offsets
- ✅ RequestAnimationFrame for smooth counters

---

## 🎨 Visual Design Improvements

1. **Typography hierarchy** - Larger, bolder headings
2. **Decorative elements** - Lines, dots, icons
3. **Color accents** - Strategic use of brand colors (apricot, sage, pine)
4. **Depth layers** - Background blurs, shadows, overlays
5. **Interactive feedback** - Hover states, scale effects
6. **Spacing rhythm** - Better padding and gaps
7. **Glass-morphism** - Backdrop blur effects

---

## 🚀 How to Test

1. Navigate to `/about` page
2. Scroll slowly to see parallax effects
3. Watch timeline line fill as you scroll
4. Observe number counters animate when visible
5. Hover over timeline cards and project images
6. Check character animations on hero title

---

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adjust Animation Speed:
- Change `duration` values in transition objects
- Modify `delay` values for stagger timing

### Change Parallax Distance:
- Adjust values in `useTransform` arrays
- Example: `[0, 1], ['0%', '50%']` → change '50%'

### Modify Easing:
- Use built-in easings: `easeSmooth`, `easeSlow`, `easeElastic`
- Custom cubic bezier: `[0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1]`
