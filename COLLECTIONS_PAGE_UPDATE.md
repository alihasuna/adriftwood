## Design Principles

### Art Gallery Aesthetic
- **Framing**: Corner brackets evoke gallery frames
- **Numbering**: Sequential badges like museum pieces
- **Spacing**: Generous white space
- **Typography**: Large, elegant type treatment
- **Minimalism**: Let the photography shine

### Photography as Art
- **Hero Images**: Large, high-quality product photography
- **Varied Sizes**: Creates visual rhythm and interest
- **Zoom on Hover**: Invites closer inspection
- **Clean Overlays**: Information doesn't overwhelm images

### Storytelling Focus
- **Material Details**: What it's made from
- **Craft Story**: Why it matters
- **Collection Context**: When and where it fits
- **Artisan Voice**: Personal connection

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Details

#### Reveal Animations:
```typescript
- Hero text: Staggered slide-up (0.3s, 0.6s delays)
- Grid items: Fade + slide up (0.1s stagger)
- Gallery frames: Opacity fade on hover
- Badges: Scale + rotate entrance
```

#### Hover Interactions:
```typescript
- Image scale: 1 ‚Üí 1.05 (0.6s ease)
- Card lift: y: 0 ‚Üí -8px (spring physics)
- Materials fade: opacity 0 ‚Üí 1 (0.3s)
- CTA slide: y: 10 ‚Üí 0 (0.3s + 0.1s delay)
```

#### Modal Animation:
```typescript
- Backdrop: opacity 0 ‚Üí 1
- Content: scale 0.9 ‚Üí 1, y: 40 ‚Üí 0
- Spring physics: stiffness 300, damping 30
```

### Responsive Behavior

#### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single column grid
- All items same aspect ratio
- Stacked layout
- Full-width images

#### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- 2-column grid
- Large items span both columns
- Adjusted spacing

#### Desktop (> 1024px)
- 3-column grid
- Masonry layout active
- Maximum visual impact
- All hover effects enabled

### Performance Optimizations
- Next.js Image optimization
- Lazy loading for below-fold content
- GPU-accelerated animations (transform, opacity)
- Efficient re-renders
- Modal renders only when open

## User Experience Highlights

### Progressive Disclosure
1. **Overview**: Grid of collection cards
2. **Preview**: Hover reveals more info
3. **Details**: Click opens full story
4. **Action**: Direct link to shop

### Visual Hierarchy

1. Images (primary focus)
2. Titles (secondary)
3. Descriptions (tertiary)
4. Materials/CTA (hover state)
```

### Interaction Feedback
- Smooth transitions (no jarring jumps)
- Spring physics (natural feel)
- Clear hover states
- Loading states handled
- Click targets adequately sized

## Content Structure

### Each Collection Includes:
- **Title**: Collection name
- **Description**: One-line overview
- **Story**: Detailed narrative (modal)

## Customization Guide

### Adding a New Collection:
```typescript
{
  id: '7',
  title: 'Your Collection Name',
  description: 'Brief one-line description',
  story: 'Detailed narrative about the craft and inspiration',
  image: '/images/lookbook/your-image.jpg',
  filterLink: '/store?category=category-name',
  size: 'large' | 'medium' | 'small',
  materials: 'Wood Type, Finish Type',
  year: '2024 Collection',
}
```

### Changing Grid Layout:
Adjust in `lookbook-grid.tsx`:
- `size: 'large'` ‚Üí Full width
- `size: 'medium'` ‚Üí 2 columns
- `size: 'small'` ‚Üí 1 column

### Modifying Animations:
```typescript
// Speed up/slow down
transition={{ duration: 0.8 }} // Change this value

// Adjust hover lift
whileHover={{ y: -8 }} // Increase for more lift

// Change image zoom
scale: hoveredId === id ? 1.05 : 1 // Increase 1.05
```

## Image Requirements

**Specifications**:
- Format: JPG or WebP
- Large items: 2400x900px (21:9)

## Philosophy

### From Product Grid to Art Gallery
**Before**: Traditional e-commerce grid
- Equal-sized thumbnails
- Dense layout
- Product-focused
- Basic hover effects

**After**: Curated art exhibition
- Varied, dynamic layout
- Generous spacing
- Story-focused
- Sophisticated interactions

### Handcrafted = Art
This design reinforces that each piece is:
- Unique (numbered badges)
- Carefully made (craft story)
- Worth appreciating (gallery framing)
- Documented (detailed materials)
- Collectible (year/collection context)

## Next Steps

1. **Add high-quality collection images**
2. **Customize collection stories** with your actual narratives
3. **Update materials** to reflect real specifications
4. **Link to actual products** in the store
5. **Test modal interactions** across devices
6. **Review hover states** for brand alignment

## Design Inspiration

The collections page draws from:
- **Museum galleries**: Framing, numbering, spacing
- **Art portfolios**: Story-first approach
- **Luxury fashion**: Minimal, elegant presentation
- **Editorial layouts**: Dynamic, asymmetric grid

---

**The result**: A collections page that doesn't just show products‚Äîit celebrates the art of handcrafted furniture. ‚ú®
