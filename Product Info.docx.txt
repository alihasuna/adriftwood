Art Work
Sculptures - Sourced from the shores of the island, each piece of driftwood carries a story of the Pacific West Coast. Shaped over time by the waves, rocks, sand and the salt. Naturally transformed into stand-alone works of art, these forms honor both ocean and land. Each creation captures the wild, untamed spirit of the island, paying tribute to its rhythms, resilience, and raw beauty.
