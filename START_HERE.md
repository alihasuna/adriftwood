## 🎬 What You'll See

### Hero Section (On Page Load):
1. Background fades in smoothly ✨
2. **"Adriftwood"** rises from bottom (1.2s animation) 🎯
3. Tagline scales up from center
4. **"50 YEARS OF QUALITY..."** slides from right (like your reference image!) 👉
5. Scroll indicator bounces

### As You Scroll:
- **Category tiles** pop up one by one with scale effect
- **Manifesto section** text appears paragraph by paragraph
- **Product cards** cascade in with stagger (120ms delay between each)
- **Everything** animates smoothly as you scroll into view

## 🎨 Animations Overview

| Element | Effect | Duration |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Hero Background | Fade in + subtle zoom | 1.5s |
| Hero Title | Rise from bottom (50px) | 1.2s |
| Side Text | Slide from right (50px) | 1.0s |
| Category Tiles | Pop up with scale | 0.8s each |
