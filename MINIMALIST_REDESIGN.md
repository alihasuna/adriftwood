# Minimalist Luxury Redesign

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive redesign of Adriftwood Site to achieve a high-end, minimalist, professional aesthetic inspired by luxury architecture and interior design portfolios.

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Language
- **Ultra-minimalist**: Clean, uncluttered layouts with dramatic negative space
- **Bold typography**: Oversized, impactful text as a primary design element
- **High contrast**: Black/charcoal backgrounds with crisp white text
- **Refined accents**: Muted earth tones (taupe, stone, concrete) for sophistication
- **Professional luxury**: Similar to high-end architecture/interior design brands

### Key Inspirations
- Bold typographic layouts with oversized headings
- Asymmetric compositions with text overlaying imagery
- Minimal UI elements with maximum impact
- Clean lines and geometric precision
- High-quality imagery with subtle overlays

## Color Palette Transformation

### New Primary Colors
- **Brand Black** (#0a0a0a) - Deep, rich black for primary backgrounds
- **Brand Charcoal** (#1a1a1a) - Slightly lighter for depth and variation
- **Brand Taupe** (#c9b8a8) - Muted earth tone for accents
- **Brand Stone** (#a89584) - Warm neutral for secondary accents
- **Brand Concrete** (#8a8378) - Subtle gray-brown for texture

### Refined Neutrals
- Pure whites and grays with precise gradations
- Simplified from 10 shades to clean, purposeful values
- High contrast ratios for accessibility and impact

## Typography Updates

### Hierarchy
- **H1**: 7xl-9xl sizes, ultra-bold, tight tracking (-0.02em)
- **H2**: 5xl-7xl sizes, bold, dramatic presence
- **H3**: 3xl-5xl sizes, clean and modern
- **Body**: Refined letter-spacing (-0.01em) for elegance

- Montserrat as primary for modern, clean aesthetic
