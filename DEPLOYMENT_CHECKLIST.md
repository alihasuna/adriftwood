## ‚ö° Performance Optimization (Recommended)

### Image Optimization
**Current:** Using original PNG/JPG files from `Products_real/`  
**Recommended:**
```bash
# Install sharp for image optimization
npm install sharp

# Convert images to WebP and generate responsive sizes
# Example: Convert all product images
for file in public/images/Products_real/**/*.{jpg,png,JPG,PNG}; do
  # Generate WebP versions
  npx sharp -i "$file" -o "${file%.*}.webp"
  
  # Generate responsive sizes (400w, 800w, 1200w)
  npx sharp -i "$file" -o "${file%.*}-400w.webp" -- resize 400
  npx sharp -i "$file" -o "${file%.*}-800w.webp" -- resize 800
  npx sharp -i "$file" -o "${file%.*}-1200w.webp" -- resize 1200
done
```

Then update `lib/products.ts` to use WebP paths:
```tsx
images: [
  '/images/Products_real/Pine Haven/Pine-Platform-Bedframe-Queen size.webp',
  // ...
]
```

### Next.js Image Component
All images already use `next/image` with:
- ‚úÖ Automatic optimization
- ‚úÖ Lazy loading (except `priority` on hero)
- ‚úÖ Proper `sizes` attributes
- ‚úÖ Fill layout for responsive images

### Additional Optimizations
- [ ] Enable Next.js Image Optimization on hosting platform
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Enable compression (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Set up caching headers
